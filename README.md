## Drinks By Lys ##

Drinks By Lys adds a curated selection of vanilla inspired drinks to Minecraft to add variety to the diets of Players. 

This mod also aims to eventually provide players who play with Survival Mods with addition sources of thirst and temperature regulating items,
in the form of drinks.

The mod is currently under heavy WIP and will be worked on sneakily in between lunch breaks, so please be patient when waiting for new recipes.
