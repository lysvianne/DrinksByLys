## Drinks By Lys 

Drinks By Lys adds a curated selection of vanilla inspired drinks to Minecraft to add variety to the diets of Players. 

This mod also aims to eventually provide players who play with Survival Mods with addition sources of thirst and temperature regulating items,
in the form of drinks.

The mod is currently under heavy WIP and will be worked on sneakily in between lunch breaks, so please be patient when waiting for new recipes.

#### Survive
All juices and sparkling juices have the same effects as a purified water bottle (5 thirst and 6 hydration), with the bonus of gaining 2 energy. This was decided as the sugar water bottle had these effects.

### Planned features:
- Flavoured Milks (Hot/Cold Milks will be exclusive to survival mods)
- Hot/Cold Juices (Exclusive to survival mods)
- Mulled Juices 
 
### Compatability (WIP)
The following mods have inbuilt support:
- Survive
- Farmers Delight

None of the following mods have special support, but will be in the future. Feel free to create data packs with the juices and add support yourself in the meantime.
- Tough As Nails
